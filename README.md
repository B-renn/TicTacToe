### Instructions
1. Execute ruby Tic_Tac_Toe.rb in the terminal to start game 
2. Game will ask players names 
3. Enter moves with the following format - desired_row,desired_column
    example: To put your piece in the middle of the board, enter 2,2
### Error proofing
1. If you enter a row/column value that is greater than 3 or less than 0, the game will prompt you to re-enter your move
2. If you enter a location that already has a piece in that location, the game will prompt you to re-enter your move 
### Bugs
1. If you enter a position that is already taken and then enter a value that is out of acceptable range [0-3], there will be a complier error. 
    Will fix this issue later.
